# Title: Sudoku+
 
#### This is a classic sudoku game in different sizes with a slight twist of variants. As the classic sudoku, each cell has exactly one value from 1 to 9. Each row and column have unique numbers from 1 to 9 as well each 3 X 3 cells if the size is 9X9. We are providing 3 sizes i.e., 4X4 , 9X9 and 16X16 As the difficulty level increases, variants like sandwich, thermos etc., are given as part of the rules. 


## Sanwich rules:
#### As part of sandwich sum of numbers between 1 and 9 is displayed for some of the rows and columns. These hints may help the user to solve the puzzle more easily. The sandwich hint is provided only for the boards with difficulty 3 and above. Since 1 and 2 difficulty can be solved without the sandwich hints


## Thermos rules:
#### For thermos we display the patterns where the numbers are in ascending order. The initial number will always be 1. The initial cell is represented as a circle or bulb and then a line is extended from the initial bulb. The value of the number always increases along the line. The thermos hint is provided only for the boards with difficulty 3 and above. Since 1 and 2 difficulty can be solved without the thermos hints
